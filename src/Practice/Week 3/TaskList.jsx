/*Exercise Question 3: Task List with Dynamic Entries

Create a React component called TaskList.
Add an input field and a button.
Allow users to type in a task and click the button to add the task to a list.
Render the list of tasks dynamically, and ensure each task has a unique key based on its index.
Style the tasks with a border, padding, and margin for better visual separation.
You can take this example further by ensuring that the input box is cleared whenever a new task is added, and also adding 'edit' and 'delete' buttons to each task as well as their corresponding functionality.
