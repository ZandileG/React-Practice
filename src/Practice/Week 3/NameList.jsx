/*Exercise Question 1: Rendering a List of Names

Create a React component called NameList.
Use the following array of names inside the component:
const names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana"];
Render the names as an unordered list (<ul>), with each name inside a separate <li> element.
Ensure each <li> has a unique key using the index of the array.
