/*Exercise 2:

Build a multi-step form (e.g., a registration form, Tinder signup form, etc.) where form data is shared across steps using Context.

Requirements:
Create a form with 3 steps: Personal Details, Address Details, and Confirmation.
Use Context to store and update form data as the user progresses through the steps.
Display a summary of the form data on the confirmation step.

Hints:
Create a FormContext to store form data and a function to update it.
Use useContext to access and update form data in each step.
Use useNavigate to navigate between steps.
