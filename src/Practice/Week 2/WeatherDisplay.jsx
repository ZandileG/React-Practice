/*Exercise 1: Weather Display Component with Conditional Rendering

Create a WeatherDisplay component that accepts props for temperature, 
condition (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.), and a boolean for whether it is day or night. 
The component should conditionally render messages based on the weather condition and time of day.

Task:
Create a new React component named WeatherDisplay and render it in your App.js.
Use props to pass the temperature, weather condition, and day/night boolean to the above-mentioned WeatherDisplay component.
Conditionally render different messages based on the provided props.
Style the component using inline styles or CSS-in-JS for dynamic styling based on conditions.
