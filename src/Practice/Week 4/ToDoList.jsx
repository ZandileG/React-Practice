/*Exercise Question 1: To Do List
Create a To-do List app that allows users to add items to a list and mark them as completed. 
Use the useState hook to manage the state of the to-do list. This exercise only uses the useState hook

Task:
Input field for adding new to-dos
Button to submit the new to-do
Display a list of to-dos
Each to-do should have a button or checkbox to mark it as completed
When marked completed, the to-do item should visually indicate its status (e.g. strike-though text)
