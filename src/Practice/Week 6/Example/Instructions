1. Define clearly the "favourites" state and it's integration
- Navigation clearly accessible (Navbar?)
- Where should state live? Context, Props or State to pass data? (If you're passing info from Home to a Favourites page, I suggest Context)

2. Add clearly defined actions 
- Add to favourites
- Remove from favourites
- Check if already favourited

3. UI Interaction (clearly define)
- Where to trigger favourites? (modal, card, button? I suggest add a button to your movie modal for simplicity.) 

4. Display favourites
- Separate page?
- Reuse existing components? (MovieCard, modal HTML from MoviesList?)
- Handle empty favourites state clearly
