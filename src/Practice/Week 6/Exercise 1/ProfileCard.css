/*Exercise 1: Styling a Profile Card Component
Create a simple profile card component and apply CSS to style it.
Components can be individually styled using CSS in React. This exercise will focus on creating a ProfileCard component and applying CSS to make it visually appealing.

Task:
In your App.js, define a ProfileCard component (JSX code below).
Inside the ProfileCard, there is a div that will serve as the card container.
Inside the card container div, there is an image tag for the profile picture, a heading for the name, and a paragraph for the bio.
Create a CSS file named ProfileCard.css and import it into your ProfileCard component.
Write CSS to style the profile card:
Set a maximum width for the card and centre it on the page.
Apply a border and some padding to the card.
Style the image to be rounded and centred at the top of the card.
Make the name stand out and the bio be just below the name.
 

Expected Outcome: A centered profile card on the page with a rounded image at the top, a heading for the name, and a paragraph for the bio, all styled with CSS.
