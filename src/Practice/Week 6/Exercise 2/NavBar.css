/*Exercise 2: Creating a Responsive Navigation Bar

Build and style a responsive navigation bar with CSS that adapts to different screen sizes.
Responsive design is crucial for modern web applicationsâ€”this exercise will focus on creating a navigation bar that changes layout depending on the screen size using media queries.

Task:
In your App.js, define a NavBar component (JSX code below).
Inside the NavBar component, there is a nav element with a logo (can be text) and a list of links.
Create a CSS file named NavBar.css and import it into your NavBar component.
Write CSS to style the navigation bar:
Use flexbox to horizontally align the logo and navigation links.
Ensure the navigation links are on the right side of the bar, and the logo is on the left.
Apply padding to the nav element and style the links with some margin.
Use a media query to stack the logo and navigation links vertically on smaller screens.
